#### About

From the academic standpoint I am theory-oriented, but the computational part of my job also gives me great satisfaction. My background is mostly in **statistical physics** and **dynamical systems**, in particular in out-of-equilibrium physics, stochastic processes and network theory. However with my master thesis project in 2020 I have been began a journey through **mathematical epidemiology** that is still continuing to this day. In particular I have been focusing on **epidemics on complex network**, studying what effects the spatial heterogeneity has on the epidemic spreading, and **epidemic control**, in particular in relation to vaccines, optimal distribution strategies and the role of waning immunity. <br>
Some other questions that interest me and on which I hope I will be able to work in the future are the following: the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens and its effect on the epidemic patterns; multi-strain epidemic models and what is the effect of the interactions among different pathogens; and finally within-host models, for the insights that they give into many of the microscopic effects that are sometimes overlooked in population-level approaches.
